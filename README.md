# kopano-pkgbuilds
This project is building kopano groupware packages for Archlinux. That packages can be installed directly on your Archlinux.

The building process is run in a docker container. If docker is not available, the build can be run on the installed Archlinux as well.

## Branches

 - 20210102		Packages from latest Releases-Source build on Archlinux from that day (02.01.2021)
 - master		Packages from Development/Master-Source build on latest/todays Archlinux
 - master-nextiteration	Packages beeing reworked

## Clone
```console
git clone https://github.com/pietmacom/kopano-pkgbuilds.git
cd kopano-pkgbuilds
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote --checkout
```

## Update To Latest Environment
```console
cd kopano-pkgbuilds
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote --checkout
```
 
## Build Packages
All builds are done within a dynamically created docker container. This is meant to keep your hostsystem clean and untouched.

### For Latest Arch Linux
#### From Kopanos Delevelopment/Master-Branch
Please make sure that your docker host-system is beeing up to date. Unexpected changes/incompatibilities could make the latest Arch Linux image fail to build.

Of course you can try first and update second.

```console
./build-docker.sh convertToGitPackage build
```
 
#### From Kopanos Latest Release-Tag
 As you can read from the next chapter, this isn't realy planed. But with a little luck the patches (applied automaticly) from the development/master-branch will work for the latest release-tag, too.
 
```console
./build-docker.sh build
```

### For Specific Arch Linux
#### From Kopanos Latest Release-Tag
 Code from releases and their depencencies are fixed. For this reason they will have dependencies to older packages/libraries. This won't get along with Archlinux's rolling release. The build will likely fail.
 
 Anyways you can build the release packages of the day they recently/successfully compiled. Checkout the branch with the latest timestamp and compile.
 
 The script is setting up a Docker-Container with an Archlinux of that day and going to compile everything.
 
```console
./build-docker.sh build
```
 
### Without Docker
Even I discourage you from doing so, you can build everything on your hostsystem (without docker). Just keep in mind, that this will clutter up your system with a lot of build dependencies.

Simply call build.sh instead of build-docker.sh.

```console
./build.sh convertToGitPackage build
```

## FAQ
### Does it compile?
All packages are build weekly, on every monday. The last build results are shown next to the repositories commits and header.

### What's next?
 - (DONE) Make the existing packages compile with branch name => $VERSION
 - Seperate kopano-configurator and kopano-core
 - Compile package independently. Don't miss neccessary dependencies that had been installed indirectly by other packages.
 - Implement resume function to skip successfull build packages
 - Atomic releases for ARM devices.
